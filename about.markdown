# Summary

I am a Senior Software Engineer based in Cambridge (UK). I am a native C/C++ developer
for Embedded and Real Time Sytems. I started as Developer for Citrix's XenClient XT (now
[OpenXT](http://openxt.org/)) and quickly moved to higher level programming languages.

I have professional experience in Haskell. Now I am trying to share
with others what I am learning from this experience and how we can improve existing
code base using safer and more strongly typed design.

# Skills

## Functional Programming

During my professional experience I worked on different kind of projects.
I wrote a micro service for a DNS-based telementry protocol (I may write
something about it on this blog).
I also worked on the backend application of the company: scalability, protocols,
Data base, security and Continuous Delivery. The *requirements* of modern
software companies were there.

## System Programming

Sometimes you don't have much choice and you must dive into the lower-levels.
Usually, I dive into C/C++ because:

* there is a bug in existing code and it needs to be fixed;
* there is a missing interface and it needs to be implemented;
* Because I don't have choice and the company has decided to stick to C... C89.

More seriously, C and C++ are the languages used in many business and business
do not necessarily allow changes to the code base or to use languages.
Fortunately, C++, nowadays, with C++14, allows some interesting level of
type-checking and compile time code generation (yes, I mean template). So the
experience is not too unpleasant (when I can use an up-to-date compiler...).

# TODO

The list of blog posts I plan to write. Please contact me if you are interested
to see one of them being prioritised:

1. Haskell type family and Rust;
2. C++, Haskell & Rust different approches to memory;
3. DNS-based protocol: messaging over the yellow pages of the internet;
4. C++14, generate your types based on common interface;
5. C++: design Haskell/Rust enumeration-like.

### Done
